        <h2>Ancient Origins</h2>

        <p>
          Fungi have existed for over one billion years. Some of the earliest multicellular organisms, they played 
          a major role in breaking down organic matter — helping to form fertile soil on Earth.
          Fossilized fungi have even been found preserved in amber, showing their presence during the time of dinosaurs.

          Ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and Chinese held mushrooms in high regard, using them in both food 
          and medicine. The famous “Reishi” mushroom was called the “mushroom of immortality” in Chinese culture.

        <p>
          In the 20th century, fungi changed the world when <strong>Alexander Fleming</strong> discovered 
          <em>Penicillium</em> — the mold that led to the first antibiotic, penicillin. 
          This revolutionized medicine and saved millions of lives.

          Modern mycology continues to reveal fascinating discoveries: from fungi that can digest plastic to species that 
          communicate through underground “mycelial networks” — often called the “Wood Wide Web”.

      <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
      <p>
        Some fungi can glow in the dark through bioluminescence! 
        The “Jack-O’-Lantern mushroom” emits an eerie greenish glow visible in the forest at night.
